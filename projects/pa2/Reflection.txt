While working on the second homework, I ran into an interesting problem. 
While trying to start my code for the assignment, every time I ran the code, 
I would get an unable to build code error. I was confused, and even basic code 
that I knew would work had refused to run. After about an hour of opening new 
projects, deleting old ones, and trying different code, the issue somehow 
resolved itself. Once the program was no longer giving me a build error, things 
when quite smooth.

Summer and I had decided to tackle the assignment together, and while typing the 
code to print out the necessary information from the file, I had forgotten to delete
a line of code that from me making sure that the program was willing to build. I 
was confused as to why the first line of the text wasn’t showing, and I realized that 
I had a getline before my loop. Once deleted everything showed; however, that line that
I had just deleted was the key to be able to add the text in front of the need lines. 
	
The next issue that we need to resolve was how to split the height and width into two 
lines, and after looking up some more information on getline, it was easy enough to do 
with a few more lines of code.
	
Once the code was done, the next thing was creating the gif. Once the program was 
downloaded onto my laptop it went quick, but since Summer has a Mac, she ended up 
emailing her code to herself and creating the gif on my computer since she didn’t want to 
download a virus from looking up LICE on the internet because the download that you 
provided didn’t work with MacBooks.
